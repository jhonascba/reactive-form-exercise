Create a Form with the following Controls and Validators <br>
1 - Project Name (should not be empty) <br>
2 - Mail (should not be an empty and a valid email) <br>
3 - Project Status Dropdown, with three values: 'Stable', 'Critical', 'Finished' <br>
4 - Submit Button <br>

Add your own Validator which doesn't allow "Test" as a Project Name <br>
Also implment that Validator as an async Validator (replace the other one) <br>
Upon submitting the form, simply print the value to the console
